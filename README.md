Hey guys, this is a quick game I made in Python. Please excuse the horrendous organization of code 

The instructions should be on the first few lines of code for the text file, but if not i'll type them here

# PYTHOMON, A Python-based Pokemon Game

# INSTRUCTIONS

# To input data, you will need to type in the console log when prompted and
# press "enter" when submitting the input. An example would be:

# Are you a human? (y/n) -> y

# An optional tutorial is also available upon the game's start.
# Additionaly, the main menu for traversing the world has unique functions as well.

# Check: Outputs info about all the data relating to the player and progress in the game.

# Battle: Initiates a battle sequence with a random wild Pythomon. (alternative to 'move' option
# when you need to gain rewards from battle without going further)

# Move: Prompts the user to go forth before initiating a battle sequence and advancing by one tile
# upon winning the battle. (Also used to challenge gym leaders.)

# Bag: Displays all of the pythomon that the player has caught in battle.

# When in a battle sequence, there are a few options to consider.

# Attack: Executes an attack on the rival pythomon with varying power.

# Run: Executes an attempt to exit the current battle.

# Ability: If available, executes an attack corresponding to your pythomon's type.
# There are 6 different abilities, so feel free to reset to try and pick your favorite!
# A compendium of type advantages and abilities is available below in the code.

# There are four areas in the game: Village, Town, City, and Championship.
# Each has unique Pythomon to discover, and while you can't use them, by collecting
# all Pythomon in the game you can receive a special badge.

# All in all, have fun!
